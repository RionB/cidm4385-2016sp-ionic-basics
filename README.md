# Exploring ionic

The Wilken book starts exploring ionic in Chapter 4.

The book has you downloading parts of his code from Github using the `git clone` command.

You are fairly familiar with git by now.

## Chapter 4: The Resort App

Wilken's chapter 4 example app is for a ficticious resort. Some things it does are:

* Handling navigation and routing
* Displaying icons, lists, and cards
* Using external data

### Chapter 4: Step 2

Basic ionic components include:

* `ionicNavView`
* `ionicNavBar`

#### Listing 4.1
