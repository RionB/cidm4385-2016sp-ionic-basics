# Exploring ionic

The Wilken book starts exploring ionic in Chapter 4.

The book has you downloading parts of his code from Github using the `git clone` command.

You are fairly familiar with git by now.

## Chapter 4: The Resort App

Wilken's chapter 4 example app is for a ficticious resort. Some things it does are:

* Handling navigation and routing
* Displaying icons, lists, and cards
* Using external data

### Chapter 4: Step 2

Basic ionic components include:

* `ionicNavView`
* `ionicNavBar`

#### Listing 4.1

Some things to watch out for in the code.

##### Views as States

A state is the current representation of an app (from ui-router):

* URL/route associated with the view
* Controller associated with the view
* template attached to the view (states are typically linked to a view)
* ui-router: [https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki "ui-router")

#### Listing 4.2 Declaring App States

Ionic uses ui-router to handle routing. Routing is the ability to associate either a view or data by [manipulating the path portion of a URL](https://doepud.co.uk/blog/anatomy-of-a-url "Anatomy of a URL").

This is the code that does so in the `www/js/app.js` source file.
